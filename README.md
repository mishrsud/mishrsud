## My __Mantra__

  What makes me happy and keeps me going is the love of helping people.
  That it is through building great software is a happy accident.

  - Between an idea and the delivered software lies **Output** measured by **Velocity**
  - Delivered software produces an **Outcome** - measured in terms of **behaviour** (of users)
  - The long term effect of the delivered software is its **Impact**
